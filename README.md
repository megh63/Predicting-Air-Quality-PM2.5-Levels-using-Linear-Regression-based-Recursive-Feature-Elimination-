# Predicting-Air-Quality-PM2.5-Levels-using-Linear-Regression-based-Recursive-Feature-Elimination-
Air pollution has become a rising and concerning issue at the same time. In many cities across India, air pollution levels are beyond the maximum and if this trend continues, air pollution can lead to many physiological and ecological disasters.The major pollutants SO2,NO2,PM2.5,PM10.But we are going to focus on PM2.5, as this pollutant is very tiny in size that it is almost microscopic.PM2.5 refers to Particulate Matter(which is a combination of solid particles and liquid droplets) whose size is less than 2.5 micro meters.
In this model we predict PM2.5 concentration in the air using Linear Regression based Recursive Feature Elimination with Random Forest Regression(RFERF).Three models namely Decision Tree, Random Forest Regression and Gradient boosting Regression are used and the best one with optimal features and better accuracy is selected. All the models are compared with different metrics and are visualized through graphical representations.
